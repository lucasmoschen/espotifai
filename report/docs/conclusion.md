# Conclusion

In this work we presented two similarity-based metohos for automatic playlist
continuation and baseline model for comparison. 
We developed inspered on RecSys Challenge 2018 and other works
on the topic. The dataset used was generated by the Spotify API and the models
were developed using *Python*. 

We represented the similarity through a sparse matrix, an efficient data
structure for representing a large collection of playlists and tracks, in
special we can have multiple lines and columns, as long as many spaces are
zero.  

In the baseline model, we did a random walk with uniform probability in the
sparse matrix, with probability of restart the process being a Geometric
Distribution with parameter $\alpha$. In the first model, we found that with small start playlists the
algorithm 
outperforms, what is a good result. However this model is not much scalable
and some changes must be made, like a prefiltering. In the second model
a kNN is done with the playlists and it had the best performs. Both models
were pretty superior when compared to the baseline one.  

Some directions we could follow for future works is combining different
algorithms, *hybrid algorithms*. Other interesting thing to do is to
considerer the individual behaviour not directly associated with the
playlists made by them, but associated with their psyco, e.g. use the fact the
first and last algorithms are more important for the user. 

We hope you enjoy it!
