## The ACM RecSys Challenge 2018

In 2018, it was organized the [ACM RecSys Challenge
2018](http://www.recsyschallenge.com/2018/), a competition with the goal of
playlist continuation. One of the organizators was the Spotify. As described
by [Chen et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3240323.3240342), it was given
the competitors a dataset with one milion Spotify playlists alongside a
dataset with incomplete ten thousand playlists to be continuated. The
Challenge and the published papers served as inspiration for our work. 

## Papers

In 2002, [Pauws and
Eggen](http://ismir2002.ircam.fr/proceedings/OKPROC02-FP07-4.pdf) developed
*PATS: Realization and User Evaluation of an Automatic Playlist Generator*,
which inspired us in our track-based similairity algorithm. One of the
participant groups of the ACM RecSys Challenge 2018, [Kelen et
al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3267471.3267477) (2018) inspired us in our
playlist-based similarity algorithm. [Bonnin and
Jannach](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2652481) (2014) gave us an
introduction and an overview of the playlist continuation problem. Also was [A
Large-Scale Evaluation of Acoustic and Subjective Music Similarity
Measures](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/pubs/ismir03-sim.pdf) (2003). The
baseline was based on the Random Walk based algorithm from [
